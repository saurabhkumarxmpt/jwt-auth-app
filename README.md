# JWT Authentication System in MERN Stack

This is a simple authentication system built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It includes user signup, login,profile and welcome email notification.

### Features

- **User Signup**: Users can sign up with their name,username,email and password.
- **Email Notification**: After signing up, users receive a welcome email.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: JWT tokens are used to keep the user logged in.

### To Do

- **Forgot Password**: I haven't implemented this feature yet, but I'll add it soon.
