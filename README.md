# JWT Authentication System in MERN Stack

This is a simple authentication system built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This is my second project using MERN.

In this app, users can sign up and they receive a welcome email after registration. I'm using JWT for authentication and Bcrypt to hash passwords.

I haven't added the "Forgot Password" feature yet, but I plan to include it in the coming days.

Overall, it's a basic auth system where I focused on learning how signup, login, tokens, and email services work together.



### Features

- **User Signup**: Users can sign up with their name,username,email and password.
- **Email Notification**: After signing up, users receive a welcome email.
- **Login**: Users can log in with their username and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: JWT tokens are used to keep the user logged in.

### To Do

- **Forgot Password**: I haven't implemented this feature yet, but I'll add it soon.
